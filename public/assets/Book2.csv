8,20FA_ESC_LACS6200_01,,SUNY Empire State College,Economics,LACS,6200,1,Narrative in Human Experience,"This course will explore narrative in human experience, in which the perspective of 'story' serves as a metaphor to examine human experience and behavior. It is an interdisciplinary perspective concerned with the process of meaning-making, a framework for conceptualizing identity and lived experience. The concept of self as a narrative construct is a holistic one: a self story is an interactive narrative, an intricate interweaving of individual and context (arising from the way people interpret the role they play in the stories they live and the way those stories either nourish or diminish them). A self narrative is only relevant in the context of the larger stories within which it lives and breathes; we are all born into stories that began long before we arrived, and we become self within their borders: stories of culture and religion, of family and workplace, of politics and ideology
. 
Objectives of this study are to become knowledgeable about the perspective of narrative in human experience, and to explore possible applications of this perspective in various contexts (personal, academic, professional). The study may focus on human development and identity, aging, illness, or other aspects of human experience depending on the student‚Äôs needs and interests.",,,,Graduate,,3,9/8/20,12/18/20,http://www.esc.edu/bookstore/,https://www.esc.edu/admissions/,TRUE,Online,,
